                    For the purpose of backward-compatibility, web browsers will continue to support these deprecated HTML tags, but the changes to the HTML specification do demonstrate the desire of the community for HTML to return to its original purpose of describing the structure of content, while encouraging developers to use cascading style sheets for formatting purposes.

Using CSS, you can control the color of the text, the style of fonts, the spacing between paragraphs, how columns are sized and laid out, what background images or colors are used, layout designs,variations in display for different devices and screen sizes as well as a variety of other effects.CSS is easy to learn and understand but it provides powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document. Most commonly, CSS is combined with the markup languages HTML or XHTML.CSS is created and maintained through a group of people within the W3C called the CSS Working Group. The CSS Working Group creates documents called specifications. When a specification has been discussed and officially ratified by the W3C members, it becomes a recommendation.These ratified specifications are called recommendations because the W3C has no control over the actual implementation of the language. Independent companies and organizations create that software.The World Wide Web Consortium, or W3C is a group that makes recommendations about how

                    <p id="J">JS: JavaScript is a scripting language used to create and control dynamic website content—but that might not make a lot of sense if you’re new to tech. So let’s replace “dynamic website content” with “things that move, refresh, or otherwise change on your screen without requiring you to manually reload a web page.”Think features like animated graphics, photo slideshows, autocomplete text suggestions, and interactive forms. Or even better, think about web features you completely take for granted, like when your Facebook timeline updates on your screen or Google suggests search terms based on a few letters you’ve typed into your search bar. In both cases, that’s JavaScript in action.If you’re reading this, though, then you know that there’s a lot that goes into JavaScript and how web developers use it. Here at Skillcrush, we teach an entire segment on JavaScript in our Front End Web Developer and Break into Tech Blueprints. So yeah, there’s a lot more to get into in this article.If you’re hoping to break into a career in tech, your question might sound more like: “what is JavaScript and do I need it?”You can see from the examples above that—if you’re interested in web development—the answer is a resounding yes. So with that out of the way, let’s go a bit deeper into how JavaScript works and what you’ll really use it for.
